        Participation in Marathon
    </h3>
</strong>

<p>
    In May 2018, I participated in a 4.2K Marathon in Banglore.

    The Marathon was organized by TCS.
    <br>
    That was the very first Marathon where I participated and also finished the track by time hence got a Medal from TCS.

    <h3>
        Attend Conference
    </h3>
</strong>

<p>
    In the year of 2018, I was there in Mitra Jyothi in Banglore for cupple of months for learning to operate screen reader and also got trained in mobility for travelling any where independently.
</p>
<p>

</a>

<p>
    In Mitra Jyothi only, I attended a conference which was about Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) and understood very well that being a developer, I always have to keep in mind that what ever I will develop through out my life would have to be very much accessible in terms of every thing to target the people of each and every community.
    <br>
On that conference, the main focus was the accessibility issues for visually impaired people but there was a clear message that each and every thing should be very much accessible for all of us.
</p>
<p>
    To have the better understanding of accessibility, this video can be reffered.
